To document their journey, the team created an Engineering Journal to record progress, challenges, and key discoveries throughout the project. This journal serves as a detailed record of their work - from brainstorming ideas and building prototypes to overcoming technical obstacles and refining their design. It highlights their problem-solving approach, lessons learned, and breakthroughs that shaped the final product. Anyone interested in their development process can view the journal in this [Google Sheets link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQThhySzCHDFsmEal74Kzdd9_QFJvTe4QPTKtl-mGtYmJ0RncUEklOFNRiIiaTZJJA9F67_3sHgV47u/pubhtml), which offers valuable insight into the teamâ€™s engineering mindset and creative thinking.
